[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/workflowrBeta)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=workflowrBeta)

**NOTE: This is workflowrBeta. This package should only be used by early
adopters of workflowr that do not want to migrate their existing projects. If
you are starting a new project, please use the latest [workflowr
release](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr). All feature development and
other improvements will happen there. In contrast, workflowrBeta will only
receive bug fixes.**

The [workflowr][] R package makes it easier for researchers to
organize their projects and share their results with colleagues. 

Install the latest release (v0.11.0) by running this command in R or
RStudio:

```r
devtools::install_github("jdblischak/workflowrBeta", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

If you are already writing R code to analyze data, and know the basics
of Git and GitHub, you can start taking advantage of workflowr
immediately. In a matter of minutes, you can create a research website
like [this][demo01]. (See also the [Divvy data exploration project][divvy]
for a more elaborate example of a workflowr project.)

If you find any problems, or would like to suggest new features,
please open an [Issue][issues].

## Why use workflowr?

First, hopefully you don't need much convincing to write your analyses
in R Markdown. It allows you to combine your R code, text, and figures
in the same document! See the [website][rmarkdown] to learn about all
the cool features.  Second, building a website with the rmarkdown
package (as opposed to using knitr to produce Markdown files and
passing these to a static site generator) enables you to use all the
latest R packages (e.g. [htmlwidgets][]) directly in your
analyses. Third, the workflowr package provides functions to make it
easier for a researcher to maintain a version-controlled R Markdown
website:

* A function to start a project with all the necessary files (see `?wflow_start`)
* Includes an R Markdown template that will automatically insert the date and most recent Git commit ID (i.e. SHA1) at the top of the file to aid reproducibility (see `?wflow_open`)
* Saves generated figures into an organized directory structure
* A function that handles all the version control operations to track code development and also ensures all the R Markdown files are built in a reproducible manner (see `?wflow_publish`)

## Quick start

Workflowr builds on several software tools including
[Git][git], [pandoc][] and
[knitr][], **but you do not need to have experience using any of these
tools to get started with workflowr.** You only need to know how to
code in [R][r] and be generally familiar with the
[R Markdown][rmarkdown] format. A [basic
understanding of git][git-for-science]
as well as the [UNIX command line][swc-shell]
is not essential, but helpful.

Here is a minimal set of steps to get you started with workflowr. If you are
already using R and/or Git, you may be able to skip some of these steps.

1. Install [R][r] ([instructions][swc-r] from [Software Carpentry][swc]).

1. Install [pandoc][] using one of the following methods:

    a. (Recommended) Install [RStudio][rstudio]. RStudio includes an
    installation of pandoc. Furthermore, workflowr takes advantage of some
    RStudio features (however RStudio is not required to use workflowr).

    b. Install only pandoc following these [instructions][pandoc-install].

1. **(Optional)** Install [Git][git] ([instructions][swc-git] from [Software
Carpentry][swc]). You do **not** need to install Git to start using workflowr.
You only need to install Git if you want to perform more advanced Git
operations, which you are unlikely to need at the beginning of your project.

1. Create an account on [GitHub][gh].

1. Install the latest stable release of [workflowr][] from
[GitHub][gh] using [devtools][]:

    ```r
    # Devtools must be installed first
    #install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
    # Install a compatible version of git2r
    install_version("git2r", "0.21.0")
    # If you receive an error on macOS or Windows, try specifying type = "binary"
    #install_version("git2r", "0.21.0", type = "binary")
    # Install workflowr from GitHub
    install_github("jdblischak/workflowrBeta", build_vignettes = TRUE)
    ```

1. Work through the vignette,
["Getting started with workflowr"][vig-start], to learn how to set up
a workflowr project. (You can view all the available vignettes locally
with `browseVignettes("workflowr")`.)

1. Alternatively, if you have already started your project, read the
vignette
["Migrating an existing project to use workflowr"][vig-migrating] to
learn how to convert your project to a workflowr project.

1. Learn more about how to [Customize your research website][vig-custom].

1. If you find any unexpected behavior or think of an additional
feature that would be nice to have, please open an Issue
[here][issues]. When writing your bug report or feature request,
please note the version of workflowr you are using (which you can
obtain by running `packageVersion("workflowr")`).

## Upgrading

To upgrade workflowrBeta to incorporate the latest bug fixes, follow these steps:

* Re-install from [GitHub][gh] with [devtools][]:

```r
devtools::install_github("jdblischak/workflowrBeta", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## More about this repository

This repository contains the workflowr R package. If your goal is to create a 
workflowr project, you do **not** need to fork this repository. Instead, 
follow the [Quick start](#quick-start) instructions above.

For the most part, I try to follow the guidelines from [R packages][r-pkg] by
[Hadley Wickham][hadley]. The unit tests are performed with [testthat][], the
documentation is built with [roxygen2][], the online package documentation is
created with [pkgdown][], continuous integration testing is performed for Linux
and macOS by [Travis CI][travis] and for Windows by [AppVeyor][appveyor], and
code coverage is calculated with [covr][] and [Codecov][].

The template files used by `wflow_start()` to populate a new project are located
in `inst/infrastructure/`. The R Markdown templates used by `wflow_open()` are
located in `inst/rmarkdown/templates/`. The [RStudio project template][pt] is
configured by `inst/rstudio/templates/project/wflow_start.dcf`. The repository
contains the files `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md` to both adhere to [R package
conventions for defining the license][r-exts-licensing] and also to make the
license clear in a more conventional manner (suggestions for improvement
welcome). `document.R` is a convenience script for regenerating the
documentation. `build.sh` is a convenience script for running `R CMD check`. The
remaining directories are standard for R packages as described in the manual
[Writing R Extensions][r-exts].

If you are interested in contributing to this project, please see these
[instructions][contributing].

## Background and related work

There is lots of interest and development around reproducible research with R. 
Projects like workflowr are possible due to two key developments. First, the R 
packages [knitr][] and [rmarkdown][] have made it easy for any R programmer to 
generate reports that combine text, code, output, and figures. Second, the 
version control software [Git][], the Git hosting site [GitHub][gh], and the 
static website hosting service [GitHub Pages][] have made it easy to share not 
only source code but also static HTML files (i.e. no need to purchase a domain
name, setup a server, etc).

My first attempt at sharing a reproducible project online was [singleCellSeq][].
Basically, I started by copying the documentation website of [rmarkdown][] and 
added some customizations to organize the generated figures and to insert the 
status of the Git repository directly into the HTML pages. The workflowr R 
package is my attempt to simplify my previous workflow and provide helper 
functions so that any researcher can take advantage of this workflow.

Workflowr encompasses multiple functions: 1) provides a project template, 2)
version controls the R Markdown and HTML files, and 3) builds a website. 
Furthermore, it provides R functions to perform each of these steps. There are 
many other related works that provide similar functionality. Some are templates 
to be copied, some are R packages, and some involve more complex software (e.g. 
static blog software). Depending on your use case, one of the related works
listed below may better suit your needs. Please check them out!

## Credits

Workflowr was developed, and is maintained, by John Blischak, a postdoctoral
researcher in the laboratory of [Matthew Stephens][stephens] at [The University
of Chicago][uchicago]. He is funded by a grant from the [Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation][moore] to MS. [Peter Carbonetto][pcarbo] and [Matthew
Stephens][stephens] are co-authors.

We are very thankful to workflowr [contributors][] for helping improve the
package. We are also grateful for workflowr users for testing the package and
providing feedback---thanks especially to [Lei Sun][lsun], [Xiang
Zhu][xiangzhu], [Wei Wang][nkweiwang], and other members (past and present) of
the Stephens lab.

The workflowr package uses many great open source packages. Especially critical
for this project are the R packages [git2r][], [knitr][], and [rmarkdown][].
Please see the vignette [How the workflowr package works][vig-details] to learn
about the software that makes workflowr possible.

## Pronunciation and spelling

It is common for R packages to end with an "r", and I tend to
pronounce this as if it was "er" because I personally find this the
easiest. Thus I pronounce the package "workflow + er". Other equally
good options are "workflow + R" or "work + flower".

Workflowr should be capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, but otherwise
the lowercase workflowr should be the preferred option.
